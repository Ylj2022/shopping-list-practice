#Shopping List Project by JavaScript

This project is the practice after I learn the course [Modern JavaScript From The Beginning 2.0](https://www.traversymedia.com/modern-javascript-2-0) from TraversyMedia.

It has the following functions:

Add items by entering items in the input and clicking the `+ Add Item` button to the item list via form. If there is no item entered, there will be an alert.

Remove items from list by clicking the `X` button with the confirmation pop.

Clear all items with `Clear All` button with the confirmation.

Filter the items by typing in the filter field.

Add localStorage to persist items, so work on both DOM and localStorage.

Click on one item in the list to put into _edit mode_ and add the item text to form, and change `+ Add Item` button to show as `Update Item`, and update the item finally.

When there is no item in the list, hide the `Clear All` button and `filter`.
